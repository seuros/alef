//! `poly_fmt_lane` (in the parent file) runs `poly fmt --check .` over the whole emitted
//! tree. Every path it examines is expected to be alef-generated output that already
//! matches poly's own formatting, `poly fmt`'s hash-stamped-generated skip aside. A handful
//! of paths in the emitted tree are neither: they are written directly by an external build
//! tool (cbindgen, via the FFI crate's `build.rs`), never through alef's own writer, so alef
//! has no formatting to answer for at the point this gate inspects them. See
//! [`POLY_FMT_LANE_EXCLUSIONS`] for the specific paths and the full reasoning.

/// One glob the poly_fmt lane excludes from `poly fmt --check`, with why.

/// Every entry here is a real gap the lane would otherwise fail on that is not an alef
/// formatting defect. Mirrors `every_clippy_lane_exclusion_is_justified`'s discipline for
/// the clippy lane in the parent file: a silent exclusion here would be worse than the
/// failure it's hiding, so every entry carries a non-empty `reason`, and
/// [`every_poly_fmt_lane_exclusion_is_justified`] enforces it. ~keep

             packages/go/include/ for cgo -- alef's writer never touches either path, so it \
             has no formatting to answer for. poly.toml deliberately does NOT exclude these \
             from a consumer's own `poly fmt` (see scaffold::languages::poly's `[tools.clang-\
             format]` comment): a consumer's `poly fmt --fix` after `cargo build` is expected \
             to reformat a freshly-cbindgen-written header via the scaffolded clang-format \
             catalog tool, the same way it would any other unformatted source it did not \
             write itself. This gate runs `generate`+`scaffold` only, never that follow-up fix \
             pass, and the header materializes anyway as a side effect of the swift lane's \
             post-build `cargo build` pulling in the FFI crate as a dependency -- so the gate \
             would be asserting cleanliness at a point in the lifecycle before the intended \
