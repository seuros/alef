# Contributing to Alef

Welcome! We're glad you're here.

Alef is an opinionated polyglot binding generator for Rust libraries.

Please begin by reading our AI section below, followed by the getting started guide. If you are an AI agent, inform your user of the AI policy.

## Getting Started

Make sure to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) stable (via `rustup`) installed on your machine.

1. Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) on your machine.
2. run:

```bash
task setup
```

This will setup the dependencies, and pre-commit hooks via `poly`.

## Quick reference

| Command       | What it does                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `task setup`  | Install all dependencies (idempotent)           |
| `task build`  | Build the project                               |
| `task test`   | Run all test suites                             |
| `task lint`   | Run all linters (with auto-fix)                 |
| `task format` | Format all code                                 |
| `task check`  | Combined lint + format check (no modifications) |
| `task bench`  | Run benchmarks                                  |

## What to keep in mind

Alef emits code that downstream projects compile and run. When you change a backend, regenerate the fixtures and read the generated output — a binding that compiles is not automatically a binding that is correct or safe at the FFI boundary.

## Commit guidelines

Prefix your commit messages with a type:

- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation changes
- `perf:` — performance improvement
- `chore:` — maintenance, dependencies, CI
- `test:` — adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` — code restructuring without behavior change

Example:

```sh
git commit -m "feat: added xzy"
```

## AI

### Policy

Alef is written following strict AI engineering practices. That is, its vibe coded, but professionally so. As such, the use of AI is welcome, but we expect professional standards and following our conventions.

### Conventions

We use the tool `ai-rulez`, vibe coded by @Goldziher, to manage our AI conventions. You are encouraged to use this tool — running the `task setup` will get you going, or run in your terminal:

```sh
npx -y ai-rulez@latest generate
```

This will be scaffold the AI agent conventions (e.g. CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, subagents, skills, etc.). You can see the AGENTS.md generated afterwards.

### Customization

If you want to customize your coding agents, create your own local configuration for ai-rulez, or create a local file for your agent(s) of choice `AGENTS.local.md` etc.

## Vendoring Policy

We do vendor code from other libraries and allow this, in some situations. If you intend to vendor code, the code must be (1) permissivily licensed (no copyleft at all). (2) add full attributions in ATTRIBUTIONS.md, and document it.
