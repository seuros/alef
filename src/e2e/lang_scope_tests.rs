//! `--lang` scoping of the documentation-snippet stage.
//!
//! Split out of [`super`] (`src/e2e/tests.rs`) rather than appended to it: that file already
//! sits within reach of the modularization cap, and these tests carry their own fixture harness.
//!
//! The defect these protect: `--lang X` scoped the e2e generator stage but not the snippet
//! stage, so a single-language run rewrote every language's snippet tree. The fix must not be
//! "generate fewer snippets" -- the coverage ledger at the snippet output root is a whole-tree
//! record, and narrowing it would drop every unnamed language's ownership entry. Hence the
//! pairing below: one test proves the per-language files are scoped, its control proves an
//! unfiltered run still writes all of them, and a third proves the shared ledger stayed whole.
//!
//! # Why the fixture renders through the built-in recipe, not an extension
//!
//! An earlier version of this harness supplied snippet bodies from a local `Extension` and
//! rendered nothing at all, in every mode, so all three tests compared empty sets against empty
//! sets. The cause is worth writing down, because the obvious reading of `render_snippet_body`
//! is wrong: extensions ARE consulted before the built-in recipe there, but the snippet stage
//! inside `generate_e2e_with_extensions` does not call it with the extensions it was handed --
//! it calls [`snippets::generate_snippet_report`], which re-enters `crate::with_extensions` and
//! reads the process-global `EXTENSIONS` `OnceLock` instead. That global is settable exactly
//! once per process, so no test may populate it. A locally-passed extension therefore reaches
//! the generator and `emit_e2e` stages and never the snippet stage.
//!
//! So the fixture earns its snippets the way a real consumer's does: `[e2e.call].function` gives
//! the built-in recipe a function identity, which is the one thing it needs (proven by
//! `snippets::tests::coverage::rust_snippet_report` for rust and
//! `snippets::tests::adapter_handled` for python, both of which render with an empty IR).
//!
//! The IR stays empty deliberately. `validate_call_arg_signatures` and its siblings skip
//! entirely when `functions` and `type_defs` are both empty ("absent IR licenses no claim"), so
//! an empty surface disables the validators that would otherwise have to be satisfied; handing
//! them a partial one would manufacture failures unrelated to what these tests measure.
