//! The one place every backend names the assertions its error block cannot render.
//!
//! ~keep Every backend's error path is shaped the same way: it locates the fixture's declared
//! `"error"` value (via [`super::declared_error_value`]), renders a "the call must fail" check
//! plus — where the backend implements it — a message match, and then **returns**. Every other
//! assertion on that fixture is never visited by any rendering code, so it produces no output at
//! all: not an assertion, not a skip comment, nothing for `ALEF_E2E_STRICT_ASSERTIONS` to see. A
//! silently dropped assertion is indistinguishable from a fixture that never declared one.
//!
//! The commonest dropped shape is `equals` against an `error.<field>` path (e.g.
//! `error.status_code`). The `rust` backend resolves those via
//! `FieldResolver::accessor_for_error`, which reads `[e2e.error_field_aliases]` — a map onto
//! fields on the **Rust** error type, so it generalizes to no other language. `python` resolves a
//! narrower but real subset the SAME way for every crate, via `error_field_reachability`: when
//! the sub-field names one of the crate's whitelisted error introspection methods
//! (`ErrorDef.methods` — `status_code`, `is_transient`, `error_type`), pyo3's own error converter
//! (`src/codegen/error_gen/pyo3.rs`) already calls that method on the LIVE Rust error value at
//! conversion time and threads the result through the raised exception's `args`, so a real
//! assertion against the crate's generated `{Error}Info` companion pyclass is possible — see
//! `python::test_function::error_assertions::emit_error_assertion`. Most bindings still cannot:
//! `pyo3::create_exception!`'s bare form, the JNI/P-Invoke/cgo exception and error mappings, and
//! the C ABI (`{prefix}_last_error_code` / `{prefix}_last_error_context`) collapse a failure to a
//! message and, at most, a numeric FFI-taxonomy code before the field is ever reachable — even
//! where a backend's `error.methods`-driven class exists (dart, swift, wasm, go, java, csharp,
//! php, magnus), its own error-conversion path defaults the field at construction time rather
//! than reading it off a live error value, so an accessor there would assert a fabricated
//! constant, not the fixture's real expectation. Naming the gap is the honest fix for those
//! backends until a future change wires a live value through their own conversion path too.
//!
//! ~keep A DIFFERENT shape used to be conflated with that one and must not be again: fixture
//! authors routinely declare a fixture's error expectation as two `"error"`-type assertions — a
//! bare `{"type": "error"}` ("the call must fail") followed by `{"type": "error", "value": "..."}`
//! ("...with this message/type-name"). Every one of those `"error"` assertions IS fully rendered
//! — the bare one by the universal must-fail check, the valued one by
//! [`super::declared_error_value`]'s message-or-type-name check — so neither may be marked as an
//! unrenderable field access. Only a *second declared value* (a shape no observed fixture uses)
//! is genuinely unrenderable, because every backend's message check only ever consults the first
//! one; see [`AssertionTypeSkip::AdditionalDeclaredErrorValueNotChecked`] below.
//!
//! The rendered wording is the one
//! [`super::assertion_type_skip::AssertionTypeSkip::EqualsOnErrorFieldNotSupported`] recognises, so
//! every marker this module writes is counted by
//! [`super::fail_on_unsupported_assertion_type_markers`] — which [`render`] calls itself, so a
//! backend cannot wire the wording in and forget the gate.
