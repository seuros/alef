//! The anti-vacuity half of the Elixir oracles: proof that something still selects them.
//!
//! Every lane in the parent module is `#[ignore]`d. That is deliberate — a machine without
//! `elixir` must not report a green having evaluated nothing — but it moves the whole failure mode
//! one level up: `cargo test` runs none of them and exits 0, so if the CI step that passes
//! `--ignored` is edited away, the suite stays green and the oracles quietly stop existing.
//!
//! Neither test here is ignored and neither needs a toolchain.
//! [`ignored_elixir_oracle_lanes_are_selected_and_nonzero`] asks libtest itself how many tests the
//! oracle selection actually resolves to, so "zero tests ran" becomes a failure rather than a
//! pass. [`ci_workflow_selects_the_ignored_elixir_oracle_lanes`] checks the step that does the
//! selecting still does it.
//!
//! The workflow check reads the step's actual `run:` line and skips comment lines on the way. That
//! is not defensive styling: the comment sitting above that very step explains why `--ignored`
//! matters and therefore CONTAINS the string `--ignored`, so a `block.contains("--ignored")` would
//! keep passing after the flag was deleted from the real command. Matching the comment instead of
//! the command is precisely the vacuous shape these gates exist to prevent. ~keep
//!
//! # Porting this gate to another suite
//!
//! [`ignored_elixir_oracle_lanes_are_selected_and_nonzero`] is deliberately generic: it asks the
//! RUNNING test binary to `--list` what a filter resolves to, so it catches the one failure a
//! command-text check cannot see -- a filter that matches nothing. `cargo test --lib
//! definitely_no_such_test -- --ignored` runs zero tests and exits 0, and a wiring check that
//! only reads the `run:` line calls that green. This does not.
//!
//! To port it, copy this file and change the four constants below and nothing else:
//! [`ORACLE_FILTER`] (the substring the CI step passes), [`EXPECTED_IGNORED_LANES`] (how many
//! `#[ignore]`d tests that filter must resolve to), [`TEST_JOB`] and [`ORACLE_STEP`] (the job and
//! step names in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The two helpers at the bottom and their own
//! `the_workflow_readers_narrow_to_what_they_name` test travel unchanged. ~keep
