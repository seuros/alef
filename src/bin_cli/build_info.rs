/// same semver while differing by commit, and a cache that salts on the semver alone replays one
/// candidate's verdicts under another. A consumer agent observed exactly that — the binary on its
/// PATH changed commit mid-investigation while `alef 0.72.0` never moved.
///
/// The build time is folded in **only for a `dirty` tree**, and the asymmetry is load-bearing in
/// both directions:
///
/// * `clean` — the commit fully determines the source, so two builds of one tag on two machines
///   at two times must produce the *same* identity. Including the timestamp here would give every
///   released binary a private key space and turn every release run into a cold-cache run.
/// * `unknown` — a crates.io tarball has no `.git` but is byte-identical source for every user at
///   a given version, so the semver already identifies it completely and the timestamp would
///   again only destroy sharing. The residual this accepts: two *git* checkouts built at
///   different commits on a machine without git collide. `--version` already shouts that such a
///   build is "not attributable to any commit"; nothing here can recover what was never stamped.
/// * `dirty` — the commit does *not* determine the source, which is precisely the local
///   development case where a stale verdict does the most damage. The timestamp moves whenever
///   `build.rs` re-runs, i.e. whenever a watched compile input changed, so a rebuilt binary gets
///   a cold cache while repeated runs of one dirty binary stay warm. That is narrower than
///   bypassing the cache on dirty, which would make every local run of an expensive validation
///   pass start from nothing.
///
