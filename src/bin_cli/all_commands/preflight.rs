//! `alef all`'s pre-flight snippet-coverage check, split out of `all_commands.rs` so the
//! deferred-failure change (task #186) does not push that file over the repo's 1,000-line cap.
//!
//! This runs before the main per-crate generation loop and answers "would this run's fixtures
//! produce complete documentation-snippet coverage" -- including the mock-harness guard
//! (`e2e::snippets::mock_harness_guard`), which rejects a fixture whose generated snippet body
//! still points at e2e test-harness scaffolding. A rejection here is a real, attributable defect
//! that must fail the run, but it must not fail the run *before every other stage has had a
//! chance to run* -- one rejected fixture out of hundreds used to abort `alef all` before the
//! main loop's bindings/e2e/test-apps/docs stages ever started, writing nothing at all. This
//! function records a failure per crate and lets the caller continue into the main loop
//! regardless. ~keep
